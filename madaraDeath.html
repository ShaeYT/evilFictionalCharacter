		<center><p>Before he fought Hashirama or sometime before he died, he had preemptively placed Izanagi on himself so that when he died, he would just be revived again due to the broken hacks of Izanagi. So when he fought Hashirama at Valley of end, he got stabbed, and supposedly died. So during that battle, Madara was supposedly dead, and so they made this news widely known. But guess what? Izanagi happened. So Madara came back to life after supposedly dying, and placed a shadow clone in is coffin in order to take his place. Then he regurgitated the bit Hashiramaâ€™s flesh that Madara bit off before dying. He then somehow infused that bit of flash into himself, then during old age, he finally awakened the Rinnegan, having the power of the 6 paths.He then summoned the Gedo statue in order to sustain him self from dying, and he saved Obito, trained him a bit, infused his ideals and plans into Obito, then FINALLY, died of old age. But soon, in the 4th Shinobi war, he was soon to be revived as no other then an Edo tensei.After the war was fought on for a bit, and then, after Obito had the 10 tails ripped out of him, and as his final dying act, or supposed dying act, he was going to revive everyone in the war that had been killed, including Neji, YAY! But Madara being Madara, had black Zetsu take control of the severely weakened Obito, took control of him, and rather then reviving the dead shinobi, revived himself. So Madara's alive again!! Madara then proceeded to take the 10 tails for him self, gaining the power of the sage of six paths, along with his 2 Rinnegan, truth seeking orbs, etc. Yet, in the climax of the fight between Madara against Naruto and Sasuke, black Zetsu back stabbed Madara, having Kaguya take control of Madara, using up all of his life force or whatever, in turn killing Madara. After this Madara was FINALLY COMPLETELY dead. He is my favorite villain of all time and he was a remarkably powerful shinobi.

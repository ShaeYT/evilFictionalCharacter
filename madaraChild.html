		<center><p>Madara Uchiha grew up to become a very powerful shinobi. He not only inherited the Kekkei Genkai from his mother but with the Tengu blood inside him the Byakugan had evolved into an even more dreadful form the Sharingan! This new bloodline had 2 levels: Normal Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan. Like his tengu father, Madara possessed some incredible magical powers. he was able to use telpathy to invade people's minds, or even teleport himself across a short distance. When he turned on the Mangekyou Sharingan (he had the normal Sharingan on 24/7 just like his Hyuuga kin), the eyes would further intensify his powers and bring him even closer to a tengu form. He had developed 3 jutsus under this state, namely Tsukiyomi (to control people's minds and drive them insane), Amaterasu (to teleport objects into another dimension) and Susanoo (to create a storm like that created by a Tengus's fan).Later on in Madara's life, he became "evil" after he learns that his closest friend Hashirama was in his opposing clan. After learning this, he cut off Hashirama completely and they only ever encountered on the battlefield. Later on in life when Madara and Hashirama were adults they had a final fight to determine who was stronger and also for Hashirama to try and protect the Hidden Leaf Village. madara lost the fight and was "died", but in reality he was just severely injured.</p></center>
